## Breakdown
#### What to expect
This tab contains the thought process of developing a simple DriveTrain subsystem. Most people start with a differential drive type drivetrain to start learning actual FRC programming. I will start a Command-based project from scratch, so there will be no blanks to fill in terms of knowledge. There will also be some comments explaining some more in-depth thought processes that are going to appear in most drivetrain related projects. 
> Note: This DriveTrain uses _only_ falcons for driving. It is different for other types of motors; this is on purpose. You will not be able to find answers to every single task you will have just be looking up the docs. You need to learn the ideas behind it here and then be able to apply it anywhere.
